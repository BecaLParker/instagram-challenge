Instagram Challenge
===================
Build Instagram using Rails.

## User stories

As a user,
So my content is identifiable,
I want to be able to **sign-up, login and logout**.

As a user,  
So I can show off a photo/image,
I want to be able to **post pictures** from my account.

As a user,
So I can engage with other users' content,
I want to be able to **post comments** about pictures.

As a time-pressed user,
So I can show love for other users' content,
I want to be able to **like** a picture with one click.

Nice-to-haves:
Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!

## Planned approach

1. Produce some stories, - done
2. break them down into tasks, 
3. estimate
4. Fork this repo, clone, etc - done
5. Initialize a new rails project

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.79.0", require: false
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
