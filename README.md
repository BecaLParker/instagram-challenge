Instagram Challenge
===================
Build Instagram using Rails.

## User stories

As a user,  
So my content is identifiable,  
I want to be able to **sign-up, login and logout**.

As a user,    
So I can show off a photo/image,  
I want to be able to **post pictures** from my account.

As a user,  
So I can engage with other users' content,  
I want to be able to **post comments** about pictures.

As a time-pressed user,  
So I can show love for other users' content,  
I want to be able to **like** a picture with one click.

Nice-to-haves:  
- Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).
- Add filters

## Planned approach

1. Fork this repo, clone, etc - done
2. Produce some stories, - done
3. Break them down into tasks,  - done ([Board is here](https://github.com/BecaLParker/instagram-challenge/projects/1))
4. Initialize a new rails project
5. Hit some tickets :)

Remember to proceed in small steps! Getting confused? Make the steps even smaller.

## Code Quality

For linting, you can use the `.rubocop.yml` in this repository (or your own!).
You'll need these gems:

```ruby
gem "rubocop", "0.79.0", require: false
gem "rubocop-rails"
```

You can also lint Javascript, CSS, and ERB — feel free to research this. These
will help you to train yourself to produce cleaner code — and will often alert
you to mistakes or mishaps!
